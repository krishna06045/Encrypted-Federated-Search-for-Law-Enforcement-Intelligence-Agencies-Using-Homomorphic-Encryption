# Encrypted-Federated-Search-for-Law-Enforcement-Intelligence-Agencies-Using-Homomorphic-Encryption

This is a **secure search system** built for **law enforcement and intelligence agencies**. It allows officers to search criminal data **without revealing the actual data or the search terms** using **Homomorphic Encryption**.

Each city (like Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai) has its own encrypted database. When someone searches, all data remains encrypted ‚Äî only the final result is decrypted. All searches are **recorded using Blockchain**, and different users (Admin, Officer, Analyst) have different roles.
